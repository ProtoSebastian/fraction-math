# Fraction math library

> [!NOTE]
> This is just an old project I decided to put on GitHub, and wasn't originally meant to be published. So the code isn't clean-

As the name suggests, this is a library that does math with fractions, which avoids inaccuracies that floating-point math introduces.
There's lots of commented out code of the less efficient methods that were used, but they were kept as the code might be useful.

`main.cpp` showcases some of the features of this library

`bases.cpp` showcases the functions that convert from floating-point to fraction type tested with a few bases, though it's often very inefficient.
