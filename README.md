# Fraction math library

As the name suggests, this is a library that does math with fractions, which avoids inaccuracies that floating-point math introduces.
There's lots of commented out code of the less efficient methods that were used, but they were kept as the code might be useful.

`main.cpp` showcases some of the features of this library

`bases.cpp` showcases some bases that convert floating-point type to fraction type, though it's often very inefficient.
